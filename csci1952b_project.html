          In early 2024, Pinterest launched a body type toggle—a feature allowing users to filter women’s fashion search results by body type. 
          Promoted as a move toward inclusion and representation, the toggle sparked my curiosity as both a UX researcher and digital feminist scholar: 
          <em>Does this feature truly empower users—or just look like it does?</em>
        </p>
        <p class="intro-lead">
          This case study explores that question by combining UX research, interviews of both users and experts, and thinking about ethical design preserving users' autonomy while providing users tools
          to see themselves in the tech they interact with.
          Through user testing and empathy mapping, I uncovered key tensions between Pinterest’s intent and actual user experience.
          The project concludes with Figma mock-ups rethinking what inclusive design might look like in this context, with open-ended annotations of how dfferent designs may serve different user groups.

        <h2>A Timeline of This Feature's Release</h2>
        <h3>First I wanted to understand, <em>what pushed Pinterest to launch this toggle in the first place?</em>
          I remember as a young user in my teenage years, the platform wasn't necessarily the most body-friendly or diverse.
          <em>Did the backlash from media finally change Pinterest's strategy and how?</em>

        <h2>Expert Interview: Feminist Digital Humanities Scholar</h2>
        <h3>I chose to interview a digitial humanities scholar, focused on intersectional feminism,
          as I felt Pinterest in a very femme-leaning platform and digital experience that 
          many female and/or queer friends in Gen Z grew up with in their teenage years.
          <em>How does the femme nature of the platform affect such design decisions related to body image and self-perception on the internet?</em>

          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Pinterest is a femme-centered platform that thrives on emotional labor and curating visual pleasure, but this makes its users especially vulnerable to commodification.</li>
            <li>The body type toggle can reinforce user surveillance — offering personalization while enabling more targeted advertising based on users' self-identified body types.</li>
            <li>This kind of "choice" design is deeply shaped by neoliberal values — placing responsibility on the user while the platform profits from their data.</li>
            <li>The toggle might alleviate some harms of “thinspo” culture, but also forces users to analyze and label their bodies, which can intensify body dysmorphia or dysphoria.</li>
            <li>Sikk suggests evaluating the feature through the 
              <a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/9781517906115/bodies-of-information/">MEALS framework (Material, Embodiment, Affect, Labor, Situatedness)</a>

        <div id="ux-study-summary">
          <h3>
            <em>Goal:</em> To understand how users perceive Pinterest’s body type toggle, I conducted a UX survey with 57 respondents, focusing on body image, platform engagement, and reactions to the new feature. 
            The goal was to assess whether the toggle felt empowering or agency-centered, especially among Pinterest's core demographic: women and Gen Z.
          </h3>
          <h3>
            <em>Responses:</em> helped identify tensions in the toggle’s implementation and shaped my design revisions. 
            While the survey didn’t deeply address every responsible computing lens (e.g., nudging or consent models), the feedback gathered still provided critical user insights that informed persona creation and future mockups.

      <h2>Empathy Mapping Users</h2>
      <h3>
        After analyzing responses from the UX study, it became clear that user reactions to the body type toggle weren’t one-size-fits-all. 
        To deepen my understanding of these diverse emotional and behavioral patterns, I created empathy maps that represent key personas emerging from the data.

      <h3>
        Each persona captures key trends relationship to Pinterest in the collected UX data—from casual to committed, from empowered to excluded—allowing me to design with their unique needs, tensions, and goals in mind.

      <h2>User Interface (UI) Mock Up with Annotations</h2>
      <h3>
        This mock-up series explores four possible implementations of Pinterest’s body type toggle, each shaped by user interviews, empathy mapping, and survey data. 
        Rather than proposing a single redesign, I aimed to surface the <strong>trade-offs between agency, inclusivity, and personalization</strong>—and how different approaches may better serve different Gen Z femme users. 
        These annotated mock-ups are not final answers, but provocations for ethical reflection: 
        <em>How might we design inclusive UI without flattening individuality? How do we balance empowerment with platform-driven nudging?</em>

          <h3 class="section-subhead">Key Takeaways:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Ethical UI design requires balancing agency, empowerment, and transparency—each design explored tried to support user autonomy while minimizing platform overreach.</li>
            <li>Giving users more control (like uploading photos or adjusting sliders) can increase empowerment, but also introduces risks around labor, privacy, and surveillance.</li>
            <li>No single toggle design works for everyone—supporting different user goals requires offering customizable options, without asking users to carry the emotional or technical burden.</li>
            <li>The toggle must be more than a symbolic gesture: its algorithm, consent model, and feedback loop all shape how inclusive and ethical it truly is.</li>
            <li>Responsible UI must prioritize user wellbeing over engagement metrics—especially on femme-centered platforms where body image is at stake.</li>
            <li>I hope to take these guiding principles I pursue UX Research in realms of social media like Pinterest.</li>
