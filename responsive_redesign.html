          I approached this project with the question: <em>How can we make an aesthetic web experience actually usable—especially across device screens?</em>
          I set out to redesign a website I love using UX research and front-end design principles to bridge accessibility with visual clarity.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-lead">
          I focused on <a href="https://www.adk.de/en/">Akademie Der Kunste (AdK), Berlin's</a> website after struggling with its responsiveness on both laptop and mobile devices.
          The webpage attempts to "squeeze" in a lot of information, that for the most case feels necessary but is hard to follow and clunky.
          When examining the interface, I asked myself: <em>How can I balance improving accessibility while preserving visual style?</em>

          My process breaks into three parts: first, I assess accessibility; second, aesthetics; and finally, I bridge both in my redesigned interface.

              <li>Menus and links load quickly, but it’s unclear which elements are clickable.</li>
              <li>Interactive elements like the image gallery feel more aesthetic than functional.</li>
              <li>Redundant navigation paths create unnecessary steps to reach key pages.</li>

              <li>Event listings and the sidebar calendar feel disconnected, causing cognitive overload.</li>
              <li>Few visual cues (like buttons or icons) guide new users through the site structure.</li>

              <li>Navigation back to the homepage is only possible via an unlabeled logo — not intuitive.</li>
              <li>Responsive behavior is limited; mobile users lack clear navigation cues (e.g., hamburger menu).</li>
              <li>Navigation labels are inconsistent, with multiple elements linking to the same content.</li>
              <li>The site’s minimal branding helps highlight artwork but lacks UX affordances.</li>

          Though I felt this approach lacked structure and still left some area of subjectivity to play a role in the analysis.
          AdK is a public arts institution that should be inclusive, to different types of accessibility needs beyond responsive to device types.
        </h3>
        <h3>To test the accessiblity of the webpage, I used the industry standard tool of
          <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE's web accessiblity evaluation tool (WAVE)</a>

                I agree with the problems detected, though these are hard to catch at first without screen reader use.

                Text which is very small is difficult to read, particularly for those with low vision.

              <ul>
              This particularly is of large concern on this webpage as there is a lot of information on the opening page. 
              This results in really small labelling and text overcrowding in certain areas.

              </ul>
              <ul>
                The particular problem is that smaller text (18px and below) requires more contrast between the foreground (text) 
                and background color (mainly white on the homepage). 
              </ul>
