              <ul>
                <li>Users who had used it before did so only when staff weren’t available.</li>
                <li>Prior experience sometimes helped them anticipate the process (e.g., from observing librarians), but the interface still caused confusion.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>Assumed it would involve scanning the book but did not expect needing to scan an ID first.</li>

                <li>The number of instructional stickers caused information overload instead of clarity.</li>

            <li>This process taught me that even the simplest interfaces, like scanning a book, involve invisible friction points.</li>
            <li>This investigation piqued my interest in how digital interfaces couple with the physical experience of users.</li>
            <li>In my future user experience research projects, I would like to focus on the frictions users face when handling interfaces with both digital and physical components.</li>
